## 2026-01-08 - [Secure Protocol-Relative Links]
**Vulnerability:** The CSS selector `a[href^='http']` used for securing external links failed to identify protocol-relative URLs (e.g., `//example.com`), which inherit the current page's protocol. This left these links vulnerable to reverse tabnabbing attacks as they did not receive `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
**Learning:** Checking URL attributes using `startsWith` on the raw attribute value is insufficient. Protocol-relative URLs are a valid and common pattern that can be missed by specific prefix checks. The safest approach is to select all links and parse their resolved `href` property.
**Prevention:** Updated `js/main.js` to select all links (`a[href]`) and rely on `new URL(link.href)` to parse the resolved absolute URL. Added a check to explicitly skip non-HTTP protocols (e.g., `mailto:`) to avoid unnecessary processing.
